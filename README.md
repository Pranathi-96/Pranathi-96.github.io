### 📌 Projects I’ve Built:

#### 🔹 Loan Approval Predictor
An ML model that predicts if a loan should be approved based on user input. I used models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and KNN, and achieved around 85% accuracy.

#### 🔹 Wombix – A Women’s Wellness App
A web app built during a hackathon to support women’s health. Includes cycle tracking, nutrition suggestions, and emotional wellness tips. I worked mostly on the frontend using React & TypeScript.
